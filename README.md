# Final-Project-On-Heart-Attack-Prediction

## Project Overview  
This project investigates the application of machine learning techniques for predicting heart disease.  
The study focuses on comparing multiple classification models including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and CatBoost.  
The results highlight the performance, interpretability, and practical applicability of each model in clinical decision support.  

## Dataset  
The dataset consists of patient health records with both categorical and continuous attributes such as:  
- Age  
- Sex  
- Chest Pain Type (cp)  
- Resting Blood Pressure (trestbps)  
- Cholesterol (chol)  
- Fasting Blood Sugar (fbs)  
- Resting Electrocardiographic Results (restecg)  
- Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (thalach)  
- Exercise Induced Angina (exang)  
- ST Depression (oldpeak)  
- Slope of Peak Exercise ST Segment (slope)  
- Number of Major Vessels (ca)  
- Thalassemia (thal)  
- Target (presence/absence of heart disease)
